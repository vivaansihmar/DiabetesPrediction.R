# Diabetes Prediction in R

---

## 📝 Overview

This repository represents my first exploration into the field of machine learning using R ,First machine learning project exploring predictive modeling and APIs
. It’s an end-to-end project that demonstrates:

- Data ingestion and organization
- Machine learning model training
- API deployment for model inference

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building a predictive pipeline—from preprocessing data to serving predictions via an API.
